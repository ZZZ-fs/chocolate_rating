The goal of the project is to explore the elements that may influence the taste of chocolate, we are going to use the Chocolate Bar 2020 dataset collected by Soroush Ghaderi which carries information from 2006 to 2020 in 66 countries about chocolate reviews and tastes. The data set contains information on where the chocolate comes from, their cocoa percentage, the type of chocolate beans used, where the chocolate beans are grown, and expert ratings compiled by Brady Brelinski, who is the founding member of the Manhattan Chocolate Society, for more than 1,700 chocolate bars. We will analyze the associations between the chocolate rating and the factors including cocoa percentage, ingredients and so on.
